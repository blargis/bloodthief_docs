# Entity Reference

Thank you to FridgeLover for putting together this nicely formatted, searchable entity reference.

This will be quite overwhelming to read end-to-end. I recommend using this like a wiki or a reference manual and revisit it when you have a specific need or idea. Also use the section links to quickly jump to the documentation for a specific entity.

## Point Entities
Point entities are what they sound like: Entities that are placed at a single point in the map.

### Enemies
All enemies pretty much share the same properties, so they will be lumped together in this section.

!!!info "Key Properties"
    * hidden
        * 0: The enemy will not be hidden when the game starts.
        * 1: The enemy will be hidden and out of play when the game starts. Triggering the enemy will cause them to “unhide”
    * has_spawn_effect
        * 0: When the enemy “unhides”, there will be no spawn effect
        * 1: There will be a spawn effect when the enemy unhides
    * target
        * This property designates the entity that should be triggered when this enemy dies. So for example, if you want door1 to open when this enemy dies, you would specify door1 for the target.
    * target_func
        * The function on the target that should be called when this entity dies. For example, if our target is a door, this can be set to reverse_motion to close a door when this entity dies
    * targetname:
        * Use this to make the entity triggerable. This enemy will unhide when triggered. For example you can make an enemy hidden, and then give it targetname of e1. Then when e1 is triggered, the enemy will unhide
    * bubble_shield_id
        * Give this any value to give this enemy a bubble shield. In Bloodthief shields are typically tethered to a vt_mage and are disabled when the mage dies. If the tethered mage is shielding two different enemies, both enemies should have the same bubble_shield_id.
    * shield_type
        * Only specify this property if bubble_shield_id is set.
    * NO_AIR_DASH
        * Applies a purple shield. Air dashes will be blocked while this enemy is shielded
    * DAMAGE_ON_TOUCH
        * Applies a red shield. The player can’t touch this shield or they will be damaged

        * target
            * For the mage, the target property specifies the entity group that this mage should be tethered to with a magical shield link. Note the enemy it attaches to also needs a bubble_shield_id
        * death_target
            * This is the entity that should be triggered when this mage dies.

## Brush Entities
Brush entities are entities that are based on a brush, ie. some volume of space drawn in Trenchbroom.

### func_geo
* For the most part functions the same as worldspawn / default geometry, but with a few extra features

    !!!info "Key Properties"
        * surface_type
            * Impacts the sound your feet make when you walk on it. Use the dropdown
        * window_color

        * friction_multiplier
            * The friction of the surface
        * chain_speed
            * If using the chain texture, this determines how fast the chains will move
        * navigable
            * COMING SOON: Use this to designate a piece of geo as navigable by enemies. Right now all geo is navigable in custom maps which is not very optimized. If you are running into optimization issues let me know and I’ll prioritize this.

### func_detail
* Similar to func_geo but with less properties. The main difference is that func_detail do not have an occlusion shape built for them. You can use this entity as an optimization if your map has a bunch of little details that do not need occlusion shapes.

    !!!info "Key Properties"
        * window_color
        * navigable

### func_detail_illusionary
* Similar to func_geo, but has no collision. Use this for pieces of geometry that are purely visual and the player and enemies should not collide with it

    !!!info "Key Properties"
        * window_color

### vt_blood_area
* When the player is in this area, they rapidly increase the Blood bar and they move faster

            * Use the dropdown to specify the type of the breakable
        * gi_mode
            * Not relevant for mapping as there is only 1 gi_mode in custom maps
        * jib_count_multiplier
            * Multiplies how many jibs that should emit when broken
        * target
            * The entity that should be triggered when broken
        * target_func
            * The function on the entity that should be called when broken
        * use_fake_rigidbodies
            * 0: Don’t use fake rigidbodies
            * 1: Use fake rigidbodies (more optimized but looks worse)
        * bubble_shield_id
            * When this is broken all entities with this bubble shield ID will have their shields removed

            * 1: Collision
        * navigable:
            * If this is navigable
            * 0: No
            * 1: Yes
        * jib_scale
            * The scale of jibs
        * jib_type
            * GORE, NON_GORE, GLASS, GOD
        * hide_after_checkpoint
            * The checkpoint index at which this breakable becomes hidden
        * friction_multiplier
            * The amount of friction the player’s movement has when standing on top of this breakable

### vt_checkpoint_area
* A checkpoint. When the player respawns at checkpoint if the current checkpoint matches this area’s checkpoint index, the player will spawn here at the bottom center of this area facing in the direction specified by the angle property.

    !!!info "Key Properties"
        * checkpoint_index
            * When a level starts, the player starts at checkpoint 0. When the player enters this area, the current checkpoint will be set to at least this index. So if this is set to 1, the player checkpoint will be set to checkpoint 1. When the player respawns at checkpoint, they will spawn at the bottom center of this checkpoint by default. Alternatively, a specific point in space can be specified, see target property.
        * checkpoint_region
            * An optional property that can be set to give your checkpoint a region. Regions can be used for “non-linear” maps that can be progressed in different orders. Perhaps the left path has a checkpoint with region “left” and checkpoint_index 1 and the right path has region “right” with checkpoint_index 1. This allows the checkpoints to be reached in any order and still work as expected.
        * angle
            * This is the direction the player should be facing when spawning at checkpoint if target property is not set. In trenchbroom the direction the player will face is shown by a little arrow in the center of the checkpoint area.
        * target
            * optional property. Can be set to a vt_player_start with the same targetname to specify the exact point where the player should spawn when respawning at this checkpoint
        * checkpoint_active_trigger_count
            * Zero by default. This is the amount of times this checkpoint must be triggered before it is reachable
        * targetname
            * When this targetname is triggered, the count corresponding to checkpoint_active_trigger_count is incremented.

### vt_damage_area
* If the player enters this area, they will die. Note enemies will not be impacted by damage movers.

    !!!info "Key Properties"
        * has_piranhas
            * If piranhas should emerge from the area when the player dies
            * 0: no
            * 1: yes

### vt_damage_mover
* Exactly the same as a vt_mover except it does damage when the player touches it.

    !!!info "Key Properties (incomplete, see vt_mover for other properties)"
        * has_spikes
            * Whether spikes should be generated within the volume of this entity.
            * Note: Spike generation looks for a nearby surface normal to determine the direction of the spikes. A proper vt_damage_mover placement with spikes would be a shallow (16-32 in depth) brush that is touching a vt_mover or a piece of solid geometry.
            * 0: No spikes
            1: Spikes
        * damage_type
            * LAVA, NORMAL, DAMAGE_AREA
        * hardcoded_normal
